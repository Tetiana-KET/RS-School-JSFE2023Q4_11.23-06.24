Hey there, My name is Tatiana, I am a passionate newcomer to the world of frontend development!
Believe it or not, my journey into coding wasn't a childhood dream or a calculated career move. In fact, I never imagined myself delving into the tech world. My background? 
Well, let's just say it's far from the typical tech-savvy stereotype. I mean, I remember a time when I used to look at a computer and think, 'Okay, this is the mouse, and it clicks. That's about it.' 
So, diving into the world of coding was like stepping into a whole new universe for me. 
I graduated with a degree in foreign languages from Fedkovech Chernovtsy University. However, that was long time ago, and my English skills have gathered a bit of dust. 
So, while I do have a foundation in English, it's fair to say that I'm a bit rusty. But hey, that's where the beauty of learning comes in - I'm on a way to brush up on my skills and grow along the way.
So, how did it start? – 
It all started quite unexpectedly, really. My husband stumbled upon an ad for a week-long course 'IT Test Drive'. It was a bit of a spur-of-the-moment decision - I joined the course alongside my husband, more out of a curiosity and fun than anything else. Little did I know, that seemingly random choice would set me on an entirely new path to the world of technology.
I found myself drawn to the magic of JavaScript. And so, my self-taught journey began. Armed with determination and a thirst for knowledge, I immersed myself in the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics. It was the dawn of 2022, a challenging time for many. And for me the studying became a lifeline, a beacon of hope amidst uncertainty.
Fast forward to today, and I've made a significant progress. I've learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, explored version control with Git, get acquainted with algorithms and data structures. I've also started to familiarize myself with tools like Node.js and Webpack.
Currently I am taking the RS School Front-end course, and I am proud to have excellent results. Throughout the course, I've completed a range of projects, from crafting a responsive coffee shop website with usual functionality, such as burger menu slider, category switching and so on, to developing an intricate game -  Nonograms - a puzzle game to reveal a hidden picture. 
Each project pushed me to new heights, challenging me to think creatively.
Though, Wrestling with webpack and untangling the complexity of component-based architecture tested my patience and resolve, the thrill of mastering new concepts and the satisfaction of overcoming challenges fuel my passion for learning. 
I'm excited for what's to come. I know there's more to learn and challenges to face, but I'm ready to tackle them. 
So, I'am going to continue my mind blowning journey into the fairy world of IT, to achieve success, embrace the unknown, seize opportunities, never backing down from a challenge, and make my mark on the ever-evolving landscape of frontend development.
